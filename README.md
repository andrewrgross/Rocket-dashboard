2) Clone the files in this repo into the same folder
3) Run the file subset-2.py. It should announce that a server has started and provide a link.
4) Open the address in a web browser. In the Mint command line, you can right click and open it in a new window or tab.
5) Open the test-data.csv file and try changing values and saving. The new values should update instantly in the browser window.
